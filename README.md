# Pharaoh Prototype

This is a game prototype used during a presentation.  
It was designed to display the skills that are going to be present in the game and how they could interact with one another.  

## Skills

### Dash

A side dash used to pass through some walls (identified by a green color).  

### Grappling Hook

A grappling hook that enables the player to swing between platforms as well as climb up and down the rope.

### Sand Soldier

Summoning a Sand Soldier in front of you that will help you in many ways :  
- Rises his shield whenever the player stands on top of him to act as a platform.  
- Protects the player from projectiles/attacks (intended, not implemented).

## Scenes

I created multiple scenes to display each skills and how they could interact.  
Those scenes were made with the help of MaÃ«l Gomis & Lucas Spitz Devret (Level Designers).
